# Pi installs skills without a plugin root

Claude and Codex preserve the `soft-skills` plugin root. Their skills can read the shared plugin reference through a plugin-relative path.

Pi discovers each skill directly under `~/.pi/agent/skills`. The plugin root does not exist there. The build copies each referenced plugin-global file into only the skills that need it, preserves its plugin-relative path, and rewrites affected links.

Currently, `ai-to-delegated` receives `roles.md`. The build rejects missing relative references and paths that collide with skill-owned files.

`theory-of-mind` is a standalone skill. Other skills load it by name, so install the full set together.

The Pi archive contains these five skill directories:

- `ai-to-leader`
- `ai-to-delegated`
- `handoff`
- `peer-review`
- `theory-of-mind`
