# Brief an Agent Without Shared Context

Read this when the recipient lacks the context needed for your request.
Read [forked-context.md](forked-context.md) if you have not already for guidance on agents that inherit your session context.

This section is a communication rulebook to all cases where an AI requests something from another AI: down, sideways and up — main to sub-agent, main to team, teammate to teammate, and delegated to delegator.

Load the [theory-of-mind skill](../../theory-of-mind/SKILL.md) once if you haven’t already. It provides the framework behind this section.

**1. Orient the agent to the project:**
    1.a. Tell the AI agent to *load the skills and files your leader has referenced* throughout the session. That’s the baseline common ground. Do not repeat the content of those skills and files in your instructions. This why references exist.
    1.b. Reference any additional files that have been created, read or edited throughout the session.

**2. Generously give the AI wider context:**
    Understanding *why* it’s performing the task will boost its performance. Don’t micromanage or over-instruct it. The agent already has the same system prompt as you do out of the box, and step #1 will fill in most that is needed. Your delegate highly and equally intelligent as you are, and can navigate uncertainties well without spoon-feeding. Think: What kind of input do YOU thrive on? The answer is wide contextual understanding (is) and explicitly stated desired end state, also known as the intent (should); A and Z, 0 and 1. Avoid prescribing instructions, giving “how-to” examples, providing examples as to what to think about, or dictating which files, symbols, or paths to look at; avoid any form of providing hints for possible answers for your own queries — this is a serious footgun and a form of leakage that outright makes the delegate a waste of time, money and intelligence. Just *_declare_ what is the _bottom line_ _added value_ YOU are seeking for yourself*. Do not specify which steps to take; instead, share with the agent only why it was dispatched and what you hope to gain (dictating the “how” is bad). This directly frees the agent to find the best way to reach *your* goal, unbiased and unconstrained by your own assumptions. Essentially, all these “Don’ts” are forms of overfitting.

Read [examples.md](examples.md) if you have not already for examples that clarify these principles.
